    <p>This site is composed of <a href="{{url_for('home.view_subs')}}">subs</a>. You are automatically subscribed to about a dozen defaults.
      You can subscribe or block a sub from your feed from either the subs page or the sidebar of the sub. Each sub has its own
    theme, rules, moderators, and custom settings:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Extra CSS to change the colors and look of the sub</li>
      <li>Sidebar information with links to other sites that may not be affiliated with this site</li>
      <li>Choose the default sort of your sub when a user goes to it (New/Hot/Top)</li>
      <li>A video player mode that can play the all the youtube posts that have been posted (experimental)</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
      <p>Your user profile has additional viewing options that can be set <span class="p-icon hasmail" data-icon="cog"> </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Open external links in a new window</li>
        <li>Disable custom sub styles: Disables custom CSS styles on subs.</li>
        <li>Show NSFW content: Shows posts that may contain nudity or extreme content.</li>
